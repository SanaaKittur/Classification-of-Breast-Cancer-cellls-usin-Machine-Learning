# Classification-of-Breast-Cancer-cellls-usin-Machine-Learning
Classifying whether the cell is Invasive or Non-Invasive Breast Cancer Cell with the help of Machine Learning Algorithms which would help for the better treatment of the disease.
# Features
* Classification of breast cancer with their particular types which is Invasive Ductal Carcinoma and Ductal Carcinoma In-Situ in order to give patients the exact treatment they require.
* It acts as a database for computer science researchers interested in learning about the technical method of classifying breast cancer into invasive and non-invasive forms, as well as future researchers who may be conducting similar research. 
* Resolving the breast cancer problem utilising a machine learning system.
* This study will make a significant contribution to the medical fields everyday clinical diagnosis approach, as using machine learning to identify invasive and non-invasive breast cancer will be more accurate and time-saving than depending on a time-consuming and low-accuracy human technique.
# Implementation
* The histopathological images are made training-ready by using pre-processing steps like detection, segmentation and feature extraction. 
* Once we have the images, splitting the data into training-testing sets and feeding it into the chosen model. 
* Since there are numerous models which can be used for classification, only few of those images will be chosen for good results. 
* In the end, the model will be able to differentiate between invasive and non-invasive cancer cells, hence providing a fast and efficient way to automate the tedious work of medical specialists, at the same time, providing trustable results.
* In this project the dataset is split into 80% training, 20% testing. We then use the training set to train different models and we use testing sets to analyse the accuracy of each model.
* To compare the accuracy cross validation technique is used in which applying kfold to the data to split the training set into 10 folds. Each fold is then analysed or iterated.

# Testing
* The ratio of training and the testing when changed gives different various results, wchich shows the versatility of the Machine Learning algorithms.
* The accuracy comparison differs when the images have been shuffled as kfold is being used.
* Modifying the number of folds also leaves a great impact on the results.
* For best results and accuracy, one can keep iterating the process of prediction with modifying the above mentioned paramters efficiently.
